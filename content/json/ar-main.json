      "1": "Since my early age, I've always been fascinated by Internet. I spent most of my time on my computer playing or simply surfing on the net. Later, I started to be interested in computer science and development. I did couple of projects such as a password manager software written in Visual Basic and plenty other projects using an Arduino dev board. After being graduated of a Master in Computer Science, I leant software development using LabVIEW. I made couple of programs designed to process data measurements and testings for climatic test chambers.",
      "2": "In 2020, my curiosity led me to begin a Coding Bootcamp of 25 weeks long to study Web & Mobile App Development with Le Reacteur. This made me realise at once the power and the complexity of Internet. However, thanks to a top quality teaching staff and many efforts and hours coding, the challenge has been made accessible and I got certified !",
      "3": "Today I'm definitely ready to make my career switch to Web & Mobile App Developer. I want to make a technical and a concrete contribution helping a company to grow. I also want to work together with a team, sharing skills, tasks, advices and a bunch of nerd jokes."
